I'm also know as hugocaracol (look at the snails above). 
Iâ€™m a software engineer, by trade and passion, from Portugal.
I started this blog to record and share what I experiment and learn everyday.
My first post ended up giving the name to the blog. I see it as my own stack datastructure, one that runs push but never runs pop!

###I like to play guitar ;-)
