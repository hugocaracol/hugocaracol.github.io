Today I found [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).
>Nokogiri is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri’s many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

But the description above is not the reason of this post. This is:

>XML is like violence - if it doesn’t solve your problems, you are not using enough of it.
