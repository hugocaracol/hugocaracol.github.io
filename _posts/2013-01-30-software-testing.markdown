Today I started [Software Testing class](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs258) on Udacity.  
In the first unit Prof. John Regehr talked about a specification issue (feets vs meters) in the Mars Climate Orbiter. I remember hearing about that before 
but I got curious and found [this list of software bugs](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9183580/Epic_failures_11_infamous_software_bugs).

###Class Summary
>When writing software, destruction can be just as valuable as creation. Learn how to catch bugs and break software as you discover different testing methods that will help you build better software.
