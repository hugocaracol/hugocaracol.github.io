Every year student grads enter the work force. At least they try to. 
Through job ads they hope to catch a glimpse of something that can take them out of present despair. 
If lucky, they land a job in a multinational company.

The years go by and they're still at the same place doing the same thing they did some years ago. 
*At least Iâ€™m financially stable* - they think. But as this thought comes to mind, another one comes up...


>What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something 
wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.

>--<cite>Morpheus</cite>

Every night they go home and browse the internet for some possible solution, feel sleepy, reboot 
(dreaming about a different life)...

Until one day, someone shows up and offer them to choose between a blue and a red pill. 

>You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. 
You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
>
>--<cite>Morpheus</cite>

This rabbit-hole is full of uncertainty, adrenaline and, in the end, a sense of purpose.

With their eyes open, they start to meet people like them, people they didn't know that existed. Companies looking 
forward to hire someone like them. People that challenge the *status quo* every-single-day. But... a **BIG LOUD** but...

>I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.
>
>--<cite>Morpheus</cite>

Huge doubts in their minds. *Am I good enough? Will I let the people down?*

>What are you waiting for? You're faster than this. **Don't think you are, know you are**. Come on. Stop trying to hit me and hit me.
